**My name is Andrew Davis** Congratulations on finding my blog! Slowly over time this will be filled with tidbits from my personal journey towards becoming a developer.   I plan on making guides walking through various challenges on [CodeFights](www.codefights.com) and other websites featuring algorithm challenges. I'll also post various things about JavaScript and the web I find interesting. I really do hope to produce some useful content for anyone stopping by and of course please do let me know if there's anything specific you might like to see!

Until next time,

Andrew
